The in-built terminal now allows you to select the cursor shape. It also offers support for Use Option as Meta key, which lets the Option (⌥) key on the keyboard act as a meta modifier that can be used in combination with other keys. For example, you can use the following shortcuts:

⌥+B – go back a word
⌥+D – delete the next word
